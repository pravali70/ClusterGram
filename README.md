# 📊 Clustering Instagram Users Based on Visit Patterns and Spending Behavior

This project demonstrates how to apply **unsupervised machine learning** techniques to segment Instagram users based on their **visit frequency** and **spending rank**. Using real-world behavioral data, we implement and compare multiple clustering algorithms to uncover meaningful patterns in user activity.

## 🔍 Introduction

Social media platforms like Instagram generate vast amounts of behavioral data. Understanding these patterns is crucial for personalized marketing, user engagement, and platform optimization. In this project, we explore how clustering techniques can be used to group users based on how frequently they visit Instagram and how much they spend.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to:

- Group similar users together based on behavioral features
- Compare the results of different clustering algorithms
- Understand the nature and quality of the clusters formed

---

## 🛠️ Algorithms Used

We apply and compare the following clustering techniques:

- ✅ K-Means Clustering
- ✅ K-Medoids Clustering
- ✅ Agglomerative Clustering (Single Linkage)
- ✅ Agglomerative Clustering (Complete Linkage)

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains the following key features:

- **Instagram visit score**: A numerical score representing how often a user visits Instagram  
- **Spending_rank (0 to 100)**: A scaled score representing user spending behavior
